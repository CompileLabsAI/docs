## Overview

API keys are your credentials for accessing the Compile Labs API. Keep them secure and manage them through your dashboard.

## Creating an API Key

1. Log in at [app.compilelabs.ai](https://app.compilelabs.ai)
2. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Give it a name (e.g., "Production App")
5. Copy the key immediately

<Warning>
API keys are only shown once. Store them securely and never commit them to version control.
</Warning>

## Using an API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://api.compilelabs.ai/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{...}'
```

## Key Management

Manage your API keys through the dashboard at [app.compilelabs.ai](https://app.compilelabs.ai):

1. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
2. View all your API keys with their names and creation dates
3. Disable or delete keys as needed

### Rotate Keys

1. Create a new API key
2. Update your applications to use the new key
3. Delete the old key

## Security Best Practices

- **Never share API keys publicly**
- **Rotate keys regularly**
- **Use different keys for different environments**
- **Monitor key usage for anomalies**
- **Revoke compromised keys immediately**

## Organization API Keys

For organization-level API keys:

1. Navigate to **Organizations** → **API Keys**
2. View all organization API keys
3. Create new keys for team usage
4. Manage quotas and permissions for each key
