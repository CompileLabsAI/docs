## What is Compile Labs?

Compile Labs is a unified platform for accessing both closed- and open-source AI models—across text, image, audio, and video—through a single interface. It gives you infrastructure ownership and model flexibility, so you're never locked into a single provider and can build applications that are both performant and cost-effective.
