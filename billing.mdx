## Overview

Compile Labs provides transparent usage-based billing. Pay only for what you use, with detailed tracking across all models and providers.

## Usage-Based Pricing

All models are priced on a pay-as-you-go basis:

- **Text Models**: Per token (input + output)
- **Image Models**: Per image generated
- **No monthly fees or commitments**

## Billing Modes: Prepaid vs Postpaid

- **Prepaid (default)**
  - Increase your org limit by topping up credits: Settings → Billing → Add Credits.
  - Credits increase your organization credit limit; usage is blocked once the limit is reached.
  - You can still set optional member/API key limits for finer control.

- **Postpaid (On‑Demand Usage)**
  - Enable via Settings → Billing → On‑Demand Usage toggle (requires an active Business or above subscription).
  - Organization‑level limit isn’t enforced; usage is billed in arrears.
  - Member/API key limits, if set, still apply and can cap usage per user/key.

## Billing Alerts

Set up alerts to monitor spending:

2. Set monthly spending limits
3. Get notified when approaching limits

## Payment Methods

- **Credit Card**: Visa, Mastercard, Amex (processed via Stripe)
- **Invoice**: Enterprise accounts

We use Stripe to securely process credit card payments and Lago as our billing engine for accurate usage tracking and invoicing.

## Organization Billing

For organizations, billing is centralized:

- Team usage rolls up to organization
- Single invoice for all team activity
- Individual usage tracking per member, API key, or service account API key
