## Overview

Structured outputs allow you to define precise schemas and receive responses from AI models in a guaranteed format. This ensures consistency and makes it easier to integrate AI responses into your applications.

## How It Works

By providing a schema (using JSON Schema or similar), you can instruct the model to return data in a specific structure. The model will validate its output against your schema, ensuring you always receive data in the expected format.

## Supported Models

Structured outputs are supported by many models including:
- OpenAI GPT-4 models
- Anthropic Claude models
- Google Gemini models
- And more

## Use Cases

- **Data Extraction**: Parse unstructured text into structured data
- **API Responses**: Ensure consistent response formats
- **Validation**: Guarantee output matches your requirements
- **Type Safety**: Work with strongly-typed data structures
- **Database Integration**: Directly store parsed results

## Benefits

- **Reliability**: Always get data in the expected format
- **Easier Integration**: No need for custom parsing logic
- **Type Safety**: Match your application's data models
- **Validation**: Built-in schema validation
