## Overview

Zero Data Retention (ZDR) guarantees that your API requests and responses are not logged, stored, or retained by Compile Labs. This provides the highest level of privacy and security for sensitive applications.

## How It Works

When you enable ZDR for your API key:
- Request and response data is not logged
- No data is stored on our servers
- No training data is collected from your interactions
- Complete privacy for your applications

## Enabling ZDR

Enable ZDR through your API key settings:

1. Navigate to **API Keys** in your dashboard
2. Select the API key you want to configure
3. Enable "Zero Data Retention"
4. Save changes

All requests using that API key will have ZDR enabled.

## Use Cases

- **Healthcare**: HIPAA-compliant applications processing patient data
- **Finance**: Secure financial data processing
- **Legal**: Confidential client information
- **Enterprise**: Internal sensitive communications
- **Research**: Proprietary research data

## Privacy Guarantees

With ZDR enabled:
- ✅ No request logging
- ✅ No response storage
- ✅ No training data collection
- ✅ No analytics tracking
- ✅ Complete data deletion

## Important Notes

- ZDR applies to the full request and response payload
- Debugging and support may be limited with ZDR enabled
- Contact support for assistance if needed
- ZDR is available for all models
