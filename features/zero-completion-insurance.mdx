## Overview

Zero Completion Insurance ensures you only pay for successfully completed API responses. If a request fails, times out, or returns an incomplete response, you won't be charged.

## How It Works

Compile Labs automatically detects and excludes from billing:
- Failed API requests (errors, timeouts)
- Incomplete responses
- Network failures
- Provider-side errors
- Partial completions

You only pay for successful, complete responses.

## Automatic Detection

Our system automatically identifies non-billable responses based on:

- **Error Status Codes**: Any HTTP error (4xx, 5xx) is not billed
- **Incomplete Streams**: Streaming responses that don't complete
- **Timeout Errors**: Requests that exceed time limits
- **Provider Failures**: Errors from the underlying AI provider
- **Partial Content**: Responses cut off mid-generation

## Billing

- ✅ **Charge**: Successful, complete responses
- ❌ **No Charge**: Failed requests, errors, timeouts
- ❌ **No Charge**: Incomplete or truncated responses

## Benefits

- **Cost Predictability**: Only pay for successful requests
- **No Waste**: Failed attempts don't add up
- **Fair Billing**: Pay only for delivered value
- **Transparent**: Clear distinction in your usage dashboard

## Viewing Usage

In your usage dashboard, you'll see:
- Total successful requests (billed)
- Failed requests (not billed)
- Success rate metrics
- Cost breakdown by model

## Best Practices

- Monitor your success rate to identify issues
- Check error logs to improve request quality
- Use appropriate timeouts for your use case
- Handle errors gracefully in your application
