## Overview

Compile Labs uses a flexible quota system with three levels and provides detailed cost tracking to help you manage spending effectively.

## No Platform Fees

Compile Labs charges **zero platform fees**. You only pay for actual usage of AI models. There are no:
- Minimum commitments
- Setup fees
- Platform access fees
- Hidden charges

You pay exactly what you use, when you use it.

## Quota System

Compile Labs uses a hierarchical quota system with three levels:

1. **Organization Level**: Total spending limit for the entire organization
2. **Member Level**: Individual user or service account spending limits
3. **API Key Level**: Per-key spending limits for granular control

### How Quotas Cascade

Quotas cascade from API key → Member → Organization. If an API key has no limit set, it inherits from the member. If a member has no limit, it inherits from the organization.

**Example:**
```
Organization Credit Limit: $10,000/month
├── User A (Member) Credit Limit: $2,000/month
│   ├── API Key 1: $500/month
│   └── API Key 2: No limit (inherits from User A's $2,000/month)
└── User B (Member) Credit Limit: None (inherits from Org's $10,000/month)
    └── API Key 3: $1,500/month
```

## Reset Periods

Each quota level can have its own reset period:

- **Daily**: Resets at midnight UTC every day
- **Monthly**: Resets on the first day of each billing cycle
- **Never**: No automatic reset, cumulative spending

### Setting Reset Periods

Choose reset periods based on your needs:

- **Daily**: Perfect for development and testing with small, controlled budgets
- **Monthly**: Standard for production workloads with predictable spending patterns
- **Never**: For experimental projects where you want to track cumulative spending

## Cost Tracking

Track costs at multiple levels through your dashboard at [app.compilelabs.ai](https://app.compilelabs.ai):

### Organization Overview

View total spending across all users, service accounts, and API keys in your organization. Monitor:
- Total credits consumed
- Remaining credit balance
- Spending trends over time
- Breakdown by model or user

### User & Service Account Details

Monitor individual usage for:
- Each human user
- Each service account
- Granular cost attribution
- Usage patterns and anomalies

### API Key Analysis

Track spending per API key to:
- Identify which keys are driving costs
- Allocate expenses by project or environment
- Detect unexpected usage spikes
- Optimize quota allocation

## Setting Quotas

Set quotas through your dashboard:

### Organization Quotas

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Billing**
2. Find the Organization Credit Limit section
3. Set your desired credit limit
4. Choose a reset period (Daily, Monthly, or Never)
5. Save your changes

### Member Quotas

1. Go to **Organizations** → **Members**
2. Click on the member you want to configure
3. Scroll to the Credit Limit section
4. Set the member's credit limit and reset period
5. Save changes

### API Key Quotas

1. Navigate to **API Keys**
2. Click on the API key you want to configure
3. Update the credit limit and reset period
4. Save changes

## Best Practices

### Start Conservative

Set lower limits initially and increase based on actual usage. This helps prevent unexpected costs while you're learning usage patterns.

### Use API Key Quotas

Set per-key limits for new projects or experimental features. This provides fine-grained control and helps isolate spending.

### Monitor Regularly

Review spending weekly to catch unexpected costs early. Set up dashboard alerts to be notified of unusual patterns.

### Set Alerts

Configure notifications when approaching quota limits. This gives you time to adjust quotas or investigate usage before hitting limits.

### Review Historical Data

Analyze past usage to predict future spending. Use trends to optimize quota allocation across your team.

## Error Codes

When quotas are exceeded, you'll receive clear error messages:

- `api_key_credit_quota_exceeded` - The specific API key has reached its limit
- `user_credit_quota_exceeded` - The user or service account has reached its limit
- `organization_credit_quota_exceeded` - The organization has reached its overall limit

Each error includes details about:
- Which level hit the limit
- The reset period and next reset time
- Suggested actions to resolve the issue

## Usage Analytics

View detailed usage analytics through your dashboard:

- **Time Windows**: View usage for the last hour, day, month, or year
- **By Model**: See which AI models are driving your costs
- **By User**: Track individual team member spending
- **Trends**: Identify patterns and growth in usage over time
